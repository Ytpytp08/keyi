serp.intro_start=Hello! And welcome to the world of Pokédrock! My name is Oak, but people call me "Pokémon Professor". Strange and fascinating creatures called Pokémon live in this place! Some people see them as pets, but others see them as combat buddies. However, I dedicate myself to studying them as a profession. Let's continue! Choose the region you're most familiar with and a starter Pokémon to start!
serp.choosing_gen=Which region do you want to choose a starter from?
serp.choosing_poke=Which starter will you choose?
serp.intro_end=Good choice! I'll give you your starter Pokémon and a beginner's kit. Your Pokémon journey is about to begin, many adventures await you with your Pokémon, see you there! This addon was made by Zacek el Serpentín. Don't forget to download it officially on MCPEDL and modbay.net to continue supporting and expanding this project!

jenny.5=If you are in creative mode you can now edit trainers and Pokémon! But be careful, it is a tool that you should familiarize yourself with very well
prof.1=Studying Pokémon is exhausting work... but fascinating!
prof.2=How many Pokémon have you caught today?
